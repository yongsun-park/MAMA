# Getting Started with MAMA

**Audience:** First-time users
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes
**Goal:** Complete your first decision save and verify MAMA is working

---

## Choose your MAMA

MAMA comes in three flavors. Pick the one that matches your use case:

### 🤖 Standalone: Always-On AI Agent

**Best for:** Discord/Slack/Telegram bots, autonomous agent loops, scheduled tasks

```bash
npm install -g @jungjaehoon/mama-os
mama init
mama start
```

**What you get:**

- Always-on agent with gateway integrations (Discord, Slack, Telegram)
- Built-in MAMA OS (graph viewer + mobile chat)
- Autonomous agent loop with heartbeat monitoring
- Full decision memory across all conversations

**→ [Complete Standalone Setup Guide](../guides/standalone-setup.md)**

---

### 💻 MCP Server: Claude Desktop/Code Integration

**Best for:** Claude Desktop users, Claude Code plugin users, MCP protocol integrations

**For Claude Code:**

```bash
/plugin marketplace add jungjaehoon-lifegamez/claude-plugins
/plugin install mama
```

**For Claude Desktop:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mama": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jungjaehoon/mama-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**What you get:**

- Slash commands (`/mama-save`, `/mama-recall`, etc.)
- Automatic context injection (UserPromptSubmit hook)
- Session continuity (`/mama-checkpoint`, `/mama-resume`)
- Full decision memory in Claude conversations
- Optional HTTP embedding mode (legacy): `MAMA_MCP_START_HTTP_EMBEDDING=true` (port `3849`)

**→ Continue with this tutorial below**

---

### 🔧 Core: Custom Integration

**Best for:** Building your own tools, custom integrations, embedding MAMA in other projects

```bash
npm install @jungjaehoon/mama-core
```

**What you get:**

- Embedding & search APIs
- Decision graph management
- SQLite + vector storage
- Full programmatic control

**→ [MAMA Core README](../../packages/mama-core/README.md)**

## MCP Server Quick Start

**This tutorial covers the MCP Server path.** If you chose Standalone, see the [Standalone Setup Guide](../guides/standalone-setup.md) instead.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- ✅ Node.js >= 22.13.0 installed
- ✅ Claude Code (latest version) installed
- ✅ MAMA plugin installed (see [Installation Guide](../guides/installation.md))
- ✅ Claude Code restarted after installation

---

## Step 1: Verify Installation ✅

After installing and restarting Claude Code:

```bash
# Check if plugin loaded successfully
# You should see MAMA commands in Claude Code's command palette
```

**Expected:** Commands `/mama-*` appear when you type `/mama`

**If you have issues:** See [Troubleshooting Guide](../guides/troubleshooting.md)

---

## Step 2: First Decision Save 💾

Try saving your first decision:

```
You: /mama-save

Claude will ask:
- Topic (e.g., "project_architecture")
- Decision (what you decided)
- Reasoning (why you decided this)
- Confidence (0.0-1.0, default 0.5)
```

**Example:**

```
Topic: test_framework
Decision: Use Vitest for testing
Reasoning: Better ESM support than Jest, already configured in project
Confidence: 0.9
```

**On success:** You'll see `✅ Decision saved successfully (ID: decision_...)` message

---

## Step 3: Verify Tier Detection 🎯

After first save, check what tier you're running:

```
You: /mama-list

Expected output shows tier badge:
🔍 System Status: 🟢 Tier 1 (Full Features Active)
```

**Tier Meanings:**

- **🟢 Tier 1**: Full vector search + semantic matching (80% accuracy)
- **🟡 Tier 2**: Fallback exact match only (40% accuracy)

**If Tier 2 detected:** See [Tier 2 Remediation Guide](../guides/tier-2-remediation.md)

---

## Step 4: Test Automatic Context 🤖

MAMA automatically injects context when relevant:

```
You: "How should I handle testing?"

Expected: Before Claude responds, you'll see:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 MAMA: 1 related decision
   • test_framework (90%, just now)
   /mama-recall test_framework for full history
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**How it works:**

- UserPromptSubmit hook → Semantic search → Gentle hints (not walls of text)
- Privacy guarantee: 100% local, no network calls ([FR45-49](../reference/fr-mapping.md))

**Learn more:** [Hook Setup Tutorial](hook-setup.md)

---

## Step 5: Explore Commands 📚

```bash
# See decision evolution (supersedes chain)
/mama-recall test_framework

# Semantic search across all topics
/mama-suggest "which library should I use?"

# List recent decisions (default 10)
/mama-list

# List 20 recent decisions
/mama-list --limit 20
```

---

## Step 6: Session Continuity 🔄

MAMA helps you pick up exactly where you left off:

```bash
# Before ending your session:
/mama-checkpoint "Finished testing setup, next step is CI configuration"

# When starting a new session:
/mama-resume
```

**What happens:**

- MAMA restores your context (summary, open files, next steps)
- You don't need to re-explain the project state to Claude

**Ready to use!** 🎉 MAMA is now tracking your decision evolution.

---

## Next Steps

Now that you've verified MAMA is working:

1. **Learn the commands:** [Commands Reference](../reference/commands.md)
2. **Save more decisions:** [First Decision Tutorial](first-decision.md)
3. **Understand tiers:** [Understanding Tiers Tutorial](understanding-tiers.md)
4. **Configure hooks:** [Hook Setup Tutorial](hook-setup.md)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Commands not appearing:**

- Ensure plugin is in `~/.claude/plugins/mama/`
- Check `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists
- Restart Claude Code

**Tier 2 detected:**

- Follow [Tier 2 Remediation Guide](../guides/tier-2-remediation.md)

**Database errors:**
