> Your AI that works while you sleep.

MAMA is a **24/7 autonomous AI agent** that lives on your machine. It connects to Discord, Slack, and Telegram — runs scheduled tasks, monitors markets, reviews PRs, and remembers every decision you've ever made together.

```text
You: "Check Craigslist for Mac Mini M4 every hour and notify me"
MAMA: ✅ Cron registered (0 * * * *) — skill matched: marketplace-monitor
      → Fetches listings → Filters by price → Reports to Discord
      → Repeats every hour. You go to sleep.
```

## What Makes MAMA Different

| Feature          | Other AI Tools            | MAMA OS                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory**       | Forgets after session     | Remembers decisions with reasoning across sessions                     |
| **Availability** | Only when you're chatting | 24/7 daemon with cron scheduler                                        |
| **Skills**       | Fixed capabilities        | User-installable `.md` skills — write instructions, agent follows them |
| **Platforms**    | Single interface          | Discord, Slack, Telegram, Web Dashboard                                |
| **Agents**       | Single agent              | Multi-Agent Swarm with tiered permissions and delegation               |
| **Ecosystem**    | Closed                    | Anthropic Cowork plugins, MCP servers, custom skills — all installable |

## How It Actually Works

**1. You install a skill** — just a `.md` file in `~/.mama/skills/`. Write instructions in natural language, the agent follows them. Or ask the agent to install from the built-in catalog, Cowork plugins, MCP servers, or any GitHub repo.

**2. You talk naturally** — the agent matches skills by keywords and follows instructions exactly.

**3. You schedule it** — cron jobs run your prompts on a timer, visible in the dashboard and settings.

**4. Decisions persist** — every choice is saved with reasoning. Next session, the agent remembers _why_, not just _what_.

```text
Session 1: "Use JWT with refresh tokens"
           → MAMA saves reasoning: "Tried simple JWT, users complained about frequent logouts"

Session 5: "Add logout endpoint"
           → Agent checks MAMA → "I see you use JWT with refresh tokens..."
           → Writes matching code. No guessing.
```

## 🤔 Which MAMA Do You Need?

Choose the right package for your use case:

### 🤖 Want an Always-On AI Agent?

**→ Discord/Slack/Telegram bot with 24/7 agent loop**
**→ Installable skill system** — drop a `.md` file, agent follows it
**→ Built-in cron scheduler** — manage from dashboard or settings UI
**→ Multi-Agent System** — delegation, workflows, council, UltraWork
**→ Interactive Playgrounds** — Skill Lab, Cron Workflow Lab, Wave Visualizer

**Use:** [MAMA OS](packages/standalone/README.md)

```bash
npm install -g @jungjaehoon/mama-os
mama init    # copies default skills to ~/.mama/skills/
mama start   # opens web dashboard at localhost:3847
```

**Package:** `@jungjaehoon/mama-os` 0.12.2
**Tagline:** _Your AI Operating System_

> ⚠️ **Security Notice**: MAMA OS runs an autonomous AI agent with file system access.
> We strongly recommend running it in an isolated environment:
>
> - **Docker container** (recommended)
> - **VPS/Cloud VM** with limited permissions
> - **Sandbox** (Firejail, bubblewrap)
>
> See [Security Guide](docs/guides/security.md) for details.
> For account/policy guidance (team bot vs personal account), see
> [Standalone Compliance Notes](packages/standalone/README.md#compliance).

<summary>✅ <strong>Why CLI Subprocess? (ToS & Stability)</strong></summary>

MAMA OS deliberately uses an **official backend CLI as a subprocess** (Claude/Codex) rather than direct API calls with extracted auth tokens. This architectural choice prioritizes long-term stability:

**How it works:**

```text
MAMA OS → spawn('claude' | 'codex', [...args]) → Official CLI toolchain
```

**Why this matters:**

| Approach           | Method                            | Risk                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Direct token usage | Extract auth token → call API     | Token refresh conflicts, compatibility risk |
| **CLI Subprocess** | Spawn official backend CLI binary | ✅ Officially supported, stable             |

**Benefits of CLI subprocess approach:**

- 🔒 **Policy-Aligned** - Uses official CLI execution paths instead of reverse-engineered token flows
- 🛡️ **Future-Proof** - Backend vendors maintain CLI compatibility; reduced risk from internal API changes
- 🔄 **Auth Handled** - CLI manages token refresh internally; no race conditions
- 📊 **Usage Tracking** - Proper session/cost tracking through official tooling

**Historical Context:**
In January 2026, Anthropic [tightened safeguards](https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropic-cracks-down-on-unauthorized-claude-usage-by-third-party-harnesses) against tools that spoofed Claude Code headers. MAMA OS was unaffected because we chose the legitimate CLI approach from the start—not because other approaches are "wrong," but because we prioritized stability for an always-on autonomous agent that users depend on daily.

</details>

**Requires:** at least one backend CLI installed and authenticated:

- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/claude-code), or
- Codex CLI (`npm install -g @openai/codex && codex login`)

#### Multi-Agent System

> Built independently, announced the same day as Anthropic's [Agent Teams](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/agent-teams).
> Same vision — coordinated AI agents — but for **chat platforms**, not just CLI.

Multiple specialized AI agents collaborate across Discord, Slack, and Telegram.
A **Conductor** agent orchestrates work through four coordination modes:

```text
User message → Orchestrator → Routing
                                │
                ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
                ▼               ▼               ▼
         🎼 Conductor     🔧 Developer     📝 Reviewer
          (Tier 1)          (Tier 2)         (Tier 3)
        Orchestrates      Implements        Reviews
        Delegates         Code changes      Quality checks
```

**Coordination Modes:**

| Mode                  | How it works                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delegation**        | Conductor assigns tasks via `DELEGATE::{agent}::{task}` with depth-1 safety         |
| **Dynamic Workflows** | Conductor generates DAG of ephemeral agents — any backend/model, parallel execution |
| **Council**           | Named agents discuss a topic in multi-round structured debate                       |
| **UltraWork**         | 3-Phase autonomous sessions: Plan→Build→Retrospective with file-based state         |

**Core Features:**

| Feature                | Description                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **3-Tier Permissions** | Tier 1: full tools + delegation. Tier 2: read-only advisory. Tier 3: scoped execution |
| **5-Stage Routing**    | free_chat → explicit_trigger → category_match → keyword_match → default_agent         |
| **Task Continuation**  | Auto-resume incomplete agent responses                                                |
| **Mixed Backends**     | Claude and Codex agents in the same conversation                                      |

**Dynamic Workflow Example:**

```text
User: "Analyze the project in 3 stages"

Conductor → workflow_plan JSON
  ┌─────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐
  │ Analyst          │   │ Reviewer         │
  │ [claude-sonnet]  │──▶│ [codex]         │──▶ Synthesizer
  │ Structure scan   │   │ Code quality     │    Final report
  └─────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘
       Level 0               Level 1            Level 2
```

**UltraWork 3-Phase (Ralph Loop):**

```text
Phase 1: Planning  → Conductor creates plan (+ Council review)
Phase 2: Building  → Delegates tasks, records progress to disk
Phase 3: Retrospective → Reviews results (+ Council quality check)
         └─ RETRO_INCOMPLETE → re-enters Phase 2
```

#### Playgrounds

Interactive HTML playgrounds run directly inside the MAMA dashboard. Create skills, schedule workflows, and experiment — all without leaving the browser.

| Playground            | Description                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skill Lab**         | Create, verify, and publish skills with step-by-step wizard                      |
| **Cron Workflow Lab** | Node-based DAG editor for cron workflows (trigger → prompt → condition → action) |
| **Wave Visualizer**   | Multi-Agent task execution flow visualizer with Simulation and Live modes        |

Skills Tab and Playground Tab are bidirectionally linked — selecting a skill in Skills opens it in Skill Lab, and publishing from Skill Lab refreshes Skills.

### 💻 Building Software with Claude Code/Desktop?

**→ Stop frontend/backend mismatches**
**→ Auto-track API contracts & function signatures**
**→ Claude remembers your architecture decisions**

**Use:** [MAMA MCP Server](packages/mcp-server/README.md) + [Claude Code Plugin](packages/claude-code-plugin/README.md)

#### For Claude Code (Recommended for Development):

```bash
# Install both MCP server and plugin
/plugin marketplace add jungjaehoon-lifegamez/claude-plugins
/plugin install mama
```

**For Claude Desktop:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mama": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jungjaehoon/mama-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Package:** `@jungjaehoon/mama-server` 1.8.0

**What happens after installation:**

1. **PreToolUse Hook** (Claude Code only)
   - Executes MCP search before Read/Edit/Grep
   - Injects contract-only results + Reasoning Summary (grounded in matches)
   - Blocks guessing when no contract exists (shows save template)

2. **PostToolUse Hook** (Claude Code only)
   - Detects when you write/edit code
   - Extracts API contracts automatically (TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust, SQL, GraphQL)
   - Requires structured reasoning (Context/Evidence/Why/Unknowns) for contract saves
   - Uses per-session long/short output to reduce repeated guidance

3. **MCP Tools** (Both Desktop & Code)
   - `/mama:search` - Find past decisions
   - `/mama:decision` - Save contracts/choices
   - `/mama:checkpoint` - Resume sessions

4. **Auto-Context Injection**
   - Before editing: Claude sees related contracts
   - Before API calls: Recalls correct schemas
   - Cross-session: Remembers your architecture

---

## ✨ Key Strengths

- **Contract-first coding:** PreToolUse searches contracts before edits and blocks guessing when none exist.
- **Grounded reasoning:** Reasoning Summary is derived from actual matches (unknowns are explicit).
- **Persistence across sessions:** Contracts saved in MCP prevent schema drift over time.
- **Low-noise guidance:** Per-session long/short output reduces repetition.
- **Safer outputs:** Prompt-sanitized contract injection reduces prompt-injection risk.

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Day 1: Build backend
You: "Create login API"
Claude: [Writes code]
MAMA: Saved contract - POST /api/auth/login returns { userId, token, email }

# Day 3: Build frontend (new session)
You: "Add login form"
Claude: "I see you have POST /api/auth/login that returns { userId, token, email }"
       [Writes correct fetch() call, first try]
```

---

### 🔧 Building Custom Integration?

**→ Embedding & search APIs**  
**→ Decision graph management**  
**→ SQLite + vector storage**

**Use:** [MAMA Core](packages/mama-core/README.md)

```bash
npm install @jungjaehoon/mama-core
```

```javascript
const { generateEmbedding, initDB } = require('@jungjaehoon/mama-core');
const mamaApi = require('@jungjaehoon/mama-core/mama-api');
```

**Package:** `@jungjaehoon/mama-core` 1.2.1

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

**Memory System:**
MAMA was inspired by the excellent work of [mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) (Apache 2.0). While MAMA is a distinct implementation focused on local-first SQLite/MCP architecture for Claude, we appreciate their pioneering work in LLM memory management.

**Agent Architecture:**
MAMA OS was inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (formerly Moltbot), an open-source AI gateway system. We built MAMA OS as a standalone implementation because:

- **Claude-Native**: MAMA OS is optimized specifically for Claude's tool-use patterns and conversation style
- **Memory-First**: Deep integration with MAMA's decision graph and semantic search
- **Simplified Setup**: Single `npm install` instead of running a separate gateway server
- **Direct CLI**: Uses Claude Code CLI directly, avoiding additional abstraction layers

The OpenClaw plugin has been [extracted to a standalone repo](https://github.com/jungjaehoon-lifegamez/openclaw-mama) for users who prefer the OpenClaw ecosystem.

**Multi-Agent Architecture:**
The Multi-Agent Swarm system was inspired by [oh-my-opencode](https://github.com/nicepkg/oh-my-opencode), a multi-agent orchestration framework for AI coding assistants. While MAMA's swarm shares the vision of coordinated AI agents with tiered permissions, it was built specifically for **chat platforms** (Discord, Slack, Telegram) rather than CLI environments, enabling collaborative agent teams accessible from anywhere.

**Planning Workflows:**
MAMA's Conductor agent integrates workflow templates from [BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD) (MIT License, Copyright BMad Code, LLC). The BMAD Method provides structured planning artifacts (product briefs, PRDs, tech specs, architecture docs) that the Conductor uses to orchestrate multi-step project planning.
